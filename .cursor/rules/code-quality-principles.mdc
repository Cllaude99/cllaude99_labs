# Code Quality Principles

When writing or reviewing code, always apply these four core principles:

## 1. Readability

Write code that is easy to understand at first glance.

- Name magic numbers with descriptive constants
- Abstract complex logic into dedicated components
- Separate code paths for different conditional rendering
- Simplify complex ternary operators
- Colocate simple logic to reduce eye movement
- Name complex conditions with meaningful variables

See `@code-quality/readability` for detailed patterns and examples.

## 2. Predictability

Ensure code behaves as expected based on its name and signature.

- Standardize return types for similar functions/hooks
- Reveal hidden logic - avoid side effects (Single Responsibility)
- Use unique and descriptive names to avoid ambiguity

See `@code-quality/predictability` for detailed patterns and examples.

## 3. Cohesion

Keep related code together in well-defined modules.

- Consider form cohesion (field-level vs form-level)
- Organize code by feature/domain, not just by type
- Relate magic numbers to the logic they represent

See `@code-quality/cohesion` for detailed patterns and examples.

## 4. Coupling

Minimize dependencies between different parts of the codebase.

- Balance abstraction - avoid premature optimization
- Scope state management into smaller, focused hooks
- Eliminate Props Drilling with Component Composition

See `@code-quality/coupling` for detailed patterns and examples.
